My own personal blog. It's built on top of <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now</a>. It's pretty basic but functional. In time I will overhaul my website to make something that meets my demands. For now this will suffice :)
